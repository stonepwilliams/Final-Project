  <h3>Are You Thirsty?!</h3>
  <br>
  <br>
        <p2>Belly was born with the idea that Taipei needed to be introduced to a bar that offers amazing local offerings but also a wide variety of beers from around the world. Now as Belly Barcade, we carry on this idea with our diverse and delicious collection of beers. We pride ourselves in the notion of East Drinks West: some of the best beers from the other side of the world can be had right here in Taiwan! Here is a list of some of the brewing companies outside of Taiwan that are featured here at Belly Barcade:

            <ul>
                <li>Brooklyn Brewing Company</li>
                <li>Goose Island</li>
                <li>Evil Twin Brewing Company</li>
                <li>Sierra Nevada</li>
                <li>Clown Shoes Brewing Company</li>
            </ul>
